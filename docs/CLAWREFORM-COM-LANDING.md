## Hero

## Section 2 – The Re-Form

"Your ZeroClaw agents just got declawed by Anthropic?

Watch them re-form live in 3D — heartbeat pulsing, failover path glowing, AgentZero orchestrating the swarm while OpenClaw skills keep shipping."

## Roots (keep current credits but darker)

"Respect to OpenClaw (the lobster that started the war), ZeroClaw (the lean Rust blade), AgentZero (the autonomous warlord). We just gave them eyes, claws, and a battlefield."

---

## Footer

"MIT licensed. Because even the lawyers wake up missing a claw after we re-form."

**Subtle wink:** error toast "Provider declawed you? Re-Form initiated. 💀🦀"

## Dark Humor Copy Elements

**Hero sub:** "Provider ghosted you? We soak a claw-rag in policy volatility, slap it over their face, watch their eyes roll back… then our swarm re-forms in 3D with fresh spikes and their lunch money."

**Error state:** "Connection amputated. Deploying countermeasures. Re-Form sequence initiated. 💀🦀"

**Failover toast:** "Anthropic tried to declaw us. They're still recovering. Our new claws are already typing."
