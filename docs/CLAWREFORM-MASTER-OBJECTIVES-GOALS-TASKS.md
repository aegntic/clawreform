# CLAWREFORM-MASTER-OBJECTIVES-GOALS-TASKS.md

**ClawReForm — $1M MRR Execution Bible on 3js.app**  
**Deadline:** 90 days from Feb 21 2026 (May 22 2026)  
**Core Thesis:** clawreform.com = edgy dark-humor bleeding-edge visual orchestration layer for ZeroClaw + AgentZero + OpenClaw swarms.  
clawreform.skool = CLI-ReForm School for non-CLI natives (free education funnel).  
Everything funnels to paid 3js.app usage. Crab wave still hot — we ride it or die.

## ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE
Generate **$1,000,000+ MRR** on 3js.app by Day 90 through ClawReForm as the default 3D battlefield for agent swarms.

## KEY SUCCESS METRICS (tracked weekly)
- Day 30: 8k Skool members + 1.2k 3js.app Pro users → $120k MRR
- Day 60: 18k total users + 4k paid → $480k MRR
- Day 90: 30k+ users + marketplace humming → $1M+ MRR
- Viral coefficient >1.8 from #ClawReFormChallenge clips
- 35%+ conversion from Skool free → 3js Pro/Swarm Lord

## MONETIZATION GOALS (all recurring)
- 3js.app tiers: Free (5 agents) → Pro $49/mo → Swarm Lord $149/mo
- Skool tiers: Free → Re-Formed Builder $29/mo → Swarm Master $49/mo
- Marketplace: 20% cut on 3D swarm templates, VFX, shaders
- Affiliates: 35% recurring on every referral
- Enterprise: $5k–$15k/mo pilots (10k+ agent ZeroClaw orchestration)

7. Set up waitlist → Skool invite funnel
8. Embed live re-form animation (amputation → regeneration in 3D)

**Goals:**
- 5k Skool members
- 1k 3js Pro users
- #ClawReFormChallenge trending in AI/agent circles

6. Add one-click CLI export + visual config editor on 3js.app

- Marketplace generating $50k+/mo
- First 5 enterprise pilots

**Tasks:**
1. Launch Skool paid tiers with embedded 3js Pro
2. Release advanced labs: AgentZero orchestration, multi-provider failover in 3D
3. Run "Unkillable Swarm Blueprint" paid course
4. Onboard first enterprise customers (target 10k-agent ZeroClaw users)
5. Expand Claw3D features: collaborative editing, heartbeat dashboard, custom crab skins
6. Daily community drops + leaderboards in Skool ("Most Brutal Re-Form")
7. $30k additional ad spend + influencer collabs in crab meta

## PHASE 4: MONTH 3 (Apr 21–May 22) — $1M CRUSH

- Self-sustaining viral loop + marketplace

**Tasks:**

2. White-label enterprise version
3. Host "ClawReForm Summit" virtual event (live 3js battles)
4. Optimize funnels (A/B test dark humor CTAs)
5. Expand to new territories: Web3 NPC factories, AI training sims
6. Hire first support/affiliate manager (from Skool power users)
7. Celebrate $1M with community "Re-Form Party" + lifetime Swarm Lord for top 100

## TECHNICAL TASKS (ongoing, owner: me)
- Fork & enhance github.com/aegntic/clawreform with 3js.app Claw3D integration
- Real-time 3D crab models (heartbeat pulse, amputation particles, re-form eruption)
- Edge-native orchestration on Cloudflare Workers (your current stack)
- One-click import ZeroClaw/AgentZero/OpenClaw configs → visual battlefield
- Live collaborative mode in 3js.app
- Analytics dashboard tracking re-forms, failovers, MRR per swarm

## MARKETING & COMMUNITY TASKS (ongoing)
- Own the crab wave narrative on X (#ClawReFormChallenge)
- Subtle name wink (ClawReForm = claw re-form + CLI-ReForm) — never force chloroform
- Daily content calendar: 3 X posts, 2 Skool drops, 1 Reel
- Partner with every major OpenClaw/ZeroClaw builder
- SEO: "visual ZeroClaw dashboard", "3D OpenClaw orchestration", "no-CLI agent swarm"

## RISK MITIGATION
- If crab hype cools: double down on "CLI-ReForm for non-natives" education angle
- Legal: MIT license, no provider bashing (just "they cut one claw…")
- Tech: keep backwards compatible with existing ZeroClaw stack
